title: The PlasmaPy Project

The goal of the PlasmaPy Project is to foster the creation of an open source [Python](https://www.python.org/) ecosystem for plasma research and education.  The PlasmaPy package contains core functionality for this software ecosystem, while affiliated packages will contain more specialized functionality.

## Install PlasmaPy

PlasmaPy may be installed from the command line using [`pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/):

```shell
pip install plasmapy
```

If you have a working installation of [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), then you may install PlasmaPy with

```shell
conda install -c conda-forge plasmapy
```

## Learn PlasmaPy

[PlasmaPy's documentation](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest) describes how to use PlasmaPy and provides several [examples](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/auto_examples/index.html). 

## Get Help

The quickest way to reach PlasmaPy users and developers is through [PlasmaPy's Riot chat room](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#plasmapy:openastronomy.org).  [PlasmaPy's Discourse group](https://plasmapy.discourse.group/) is an ideal place for longer discussions on more detailed topics.

## Contribute and Report Bugs

Making [feature requests](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues/new?template=Feature_request.md), [reporting bugs](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/issues/new?template=Bug_report.md), and [offering suggestions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdT3O5iHZrLJRuavFyzoR23PGy0Prfzx2SQOcwJGWtvHyT2lw/viewform) are some of the most helpful ways to contribute to the ongoing development of PlasmaPy.  The documentation discusses how to [contribute code and documentation](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/CONTRIBUTING.html) to PlasmaPy and contains a [development guide](http://docs.plasmapy.org/en/latest/development/index.html).

## Acknowledgments

Ongoing development of PlasmaPy is supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and NASA, with many contributions from the broader plasma physics and open source communities.  Early development of PlasmaPy was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy, the Smithsonian Institution, and Google Summer of Code.
